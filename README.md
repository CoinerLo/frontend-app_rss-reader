https://frontend-project-lvl3-rho-tan.vercel.app/

Service for aggregating RSS feeds, with the help of which it is convenient to read various sources, for example, blogs. It allows you to add an unlimited number of RSS feeds, updates them and adds new entries to the general stream.

RSS is a specialized format for describing news feeds, article announcements and other materials. This is the easiest way for sites to enable users to subscribe to changes. For this, special services are used, called RSS aggregators. These services are able to poll the site's RSS feeds for new posts and show them in a convenient way, marking what they read, and so on.
